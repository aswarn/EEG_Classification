Auditory and Visual Rhythm Omission EEG Classification using Hybrid TLBO and Differential Evolution based Channel Selection

**Note**
This exploratory work was conducted between September 2022 to April 2023

**Introduction**
Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for neurological diagnosis and cognitive state analysis. Manual interpretation is time-consuming, expertise-dependent, and error-prone.

**Contents**
This repository explores automatic EEG signal classification using:
Hybrid Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) + Differential Evolution (DE) for optimal channel selection
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and ResNet-based deep models for sequence learning
Benchmark evaluation on Auditory & Visual Rhythm Omission EEG dataset

The objective is to increase classification accuracy while reducing the number of channels required for reliable prediction.
